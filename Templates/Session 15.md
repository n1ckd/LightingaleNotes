### Beginning of Notes
We start the session with Albrecht Clay and a unconscious Thom outside the session and Mars Yuli and Meara inside the basement of the manor waiting at a alarmed door that we saw the group of the supporters and the handler go through a alarmed door. 
We use the raven familiar to distract the guards with a minor illusion to draw them away from the basement entrance then the group joins together in the basement outside of the alarmed door. 
The group converses and tries to decide what to do and if they should go further and possibly die to save the people trapped in the basement / if they should press onward.
They decide to use the two potions of etherealness to send the Raven Familar and Yuli into the ethereal plane two scout ahed and report back. In the time it takes us to devise this plan the alarm spell wares off and we open the door 
door on the far right of the room and a archway on the left that goes off down a hallway, there is another door in the middle of the room. behind the door on the right we hear small fire burning. Around the archway we see a coffin in the middle of a empty room apart from two embalming tables and 3 doors one on the left right and between the tables. 
mars peeks behind the door we are passing and sees granite obsidian checkerboard floor two torches and a beautiful coffin. 
Albrecht feels a pull to the room between the embalming tables and enters the room to see a ring on the table that had crimson and black swirls 
mars statue of a pit fiend (two legged devil) that has two large arms and four devil wings and it is looking forward. the room is setup like a shrine or altar or worship chamber with benches and braziers leading up to the statue. 

Mars returns to the room he peeked into with clay and it is occupied by a very ornate coffin and two wall braziers with one slightly at a angle, when casting detect magic I doesn't see or hear anything odd about it so I choose to open it. After opening it flaming oil is dumped onto me Meara and clay 180 copper 400 silver is found inside the coffin, on turning the brazier the trap disappears. There is a door around the corner of the L and that leads into another dead end room but on investigating we find a crack in the wall that leads to a storage closet with crates and boxes in it- as well as a splintered piece of a crate with a honey comb sigil on it -  yuli pockets the piece but the rest of the crate is missing. Yuli picks the closet door open and the party is met with the smell of rot - we see a hall with a lantern at the end and a cell to the right of us. Albrecht looks into the cell to see two dead bodies rotting and we can see they are wearing clothing or fancy garbs around them but they have been dead for some time as they are infested. Yuli opens the locked door and albrecht investigates the bodies to find a ornate key that is associated with the [[Archivist]] , as well as a  note that expresses concerns with the handlers plans taking about disappearing youth from the nobles families, and that details are lacking from their plans other than the building of infrastructure. Also found is a invitation to honey hall marked with a tortle's hand (jim from [[session 13]]) Meara then burns the bodies out of respect for the archivist. 

We continue on around the corner to find another door, we proceed through it to find a large statue of a bone devil that seems to be much newer than stuff we have passed thus far, there are 4 columns in the room - upon investigating the bone devil statue we know that bone devils are not crazy high on the fiend hierarchy and that they speak infernal and they can speak through telepathy - they are resistant to non magical attacks unless the weapon is silvered. we know that devils worship lesser idols to be brought up through the ranks of hell gain power.
2 doors on the north side one door on the right with everything else in the room - the columns and the doors and everything else is older - none of the doors are locked or trapped and we look through the door on the right. Clay and Yuli sketch a [[map of the basement]] and determine that we have two paths we have not explored yet - the door in the embalming table room and the door to the right in the bone devil room, behind the door in the room where we are there is a hallway that leads further into the basement. We go back to the door in the embalming table room to investigate it and we see a room that cuts sharp to the right 15 ft ahed after looking around the corner we see an archway that leads to another room that has rubble in it - the group is concerned about the lack of enemies and members- as we enter the crumbing room we notice that its much older than alot of the other rooms and that many of the rooms were connected with newer halls. There is another door to the north that is very long like 60 feet long and turns sharp to the right after we go down it there is another long room that is very skinny 
there are circles with imagrey in them that expand outwards displaying things like imps and brimstone - they appear to be the 9 rings of hell and in the center seems to be [[Vesh]] - we surmise that it shows their rise to a lesser idol. In the rest of the room we see two doors one that leads down and one that leads onward. On the ceiling we see runes above us that are teleportation runes that lead to another plane likely the 9 hells - after investigating the loose brick we find a hidden room with 3 coffins containing 290 copper 480 silver 120gp, with no apparent normal entrance, we investigate the bookshelf and its mostly ruined old books apart from a newer piece of parchement - on which is written 

"dear handler, I am truly devout and devoted to the causes that you seek i wish to become further integrated into the cult, yours truly Vir. Olo."

as well as a quill with golden ink that evaporates off the end of it - it is a lone quill without an inkwell, its a beautiful white feather with a gray streak down the middle with golden ink dripping down the end and evaporating into the air. The quill was not previously visible until Meara picked up the quill. When Meara tries to write with the quill the ink disappears evaporating before it can be recorded. Meara gives the necklace with the keys to Yuli to try but nothing comes of it when Meara puts the necklace back on the [[Archivist]] seems to speak to them saying its a gift from them. We then hear a scream reminiscent of the wearboar
