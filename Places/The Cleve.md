Something of importance from the west beacon that Thom recognizes somehow without being able to understand much more of it.  It is an event that is important to the west beacon as [[Sorrow]] seems serve as a remembrance of the time before this event.

----
The Cleave is the product of a catastrophic event that originally split the east and west beacons. The event that created [[The Cleve]] happened generations back and so there is not much known about it. [[The River Tears]] is apart of the this area. The Cleve also seems to be the origin of [[The Infection]] that has spread to neighboring biomes like [[The Infected Woods]] causing those who lived there to perish, disappear, or move - like in the case of [[Sathas]] and [[New Sathas]].
