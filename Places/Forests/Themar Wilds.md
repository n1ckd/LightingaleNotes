The Themar Wilds are a forested area north of a long mountain range. The forest borders the mountain range all the way across and mars has not travelled south of that mountain range. Near to the Themar Wilds are a few towns including the small village of [[Esa Minor]] a larger coastal town of [[Esa Themar]] and another large snowy town of [[Wintercall]]. There are 3 main paths through the Themar Wilds that Mars would be familiar with.
