A runic arch found in the northern section of the [[Themar Wilds]] near the [[Aqueduct]]. When casting detect magic the runes on the arch appear to glow - the architecture seems to be elven and we could not deduce much from it apart from that other than it being very old and magic. 
Upon walking through the arch Mars & Yuli walked through it and felt invigorated and like we could see better. We then had a advantage on perception checks.
