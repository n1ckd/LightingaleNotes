The door is enchanted to this very very expensive inn, the inside is packed with patrons and there are dancing sparkling lights, behind the counter there is a Elf with long straight black hair with brown eyes and soft pink skin who is using many unseen servants. She is 4ft tall with a fit build, a round beautiful face with long nails and very fancy pink rimmed spectacles. She seems to be a fairly strong magic user as she is controlling many unseen servants to serve the patrons of the inn. The patrons are all very well dressed and are likely noble's and the upperclass of [[Zul]]. 

Yuli approaches the elf and with a very different confident demeanor and asks the woman in elvish if there are any vacancies and what the price is - the woman while still controlling the unseen servants, replies yes we have some vacancies - they do for eight gold pieces a night. She says her name is [[Arelen Runelenrin]]. The pink elf has been there since the founding of Zul, defining the prime shopping district as it was built around it.
