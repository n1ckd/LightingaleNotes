The Elven Council is made of 5 members (3 of them currently held by the [[Torfir Tribe]] (high elf)2 by the sarxina(wood elf) olotoris(drow) )
- the High Master- chooses who the other members of the council are and picks, he is nearly ending his term but has made a very important discovery during his 100 year tenure. we don't know what that discovery is yet as it seems to not be public news.  
- the master of economy - 
- the master of magic - 
- the master of militia -
- the master of grace - Responsible for the religious piety and the relations of citizens. Because of the elven councils decision to go with militias and not an army their influence is mainly in Zul but their influence drops heavily outside of [[Zul]].
