A wizard randomly encountered by [[Mars]], [[Yuli]] & [[Albrecht]] in [[Session 0.5]] while travelling the [[Places/Forests/Themar Wilds]] out side of [[Zul]], the mage belonged to the [[Discovery School of Magic]] and was heading south - he was a elven mage who was wearing robes that showed the crest of the School of Magic and asked if the roads were clear on the road leading south through the wilds presumably to past the Richland range. He offered a teleport to the group in exchange for gold but the exchange seemed uneasy for the amount of gold we would be giving him.
