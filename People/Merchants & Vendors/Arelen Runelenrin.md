In the history of the founding of Zul there were tribes that founded the city itself - Runelenrin was not a founding tribe but was a very core component of the building of what was once a small hamlet into the capital it is today. [[The Pink Elf]] is their establishment and it has been there since Zul was founded - the building has been passed down generation to generation with Arelen being the current owner.
