## Session Notes
After yesterdays events the group is a bit shaken after the attack and the group notices how shaken Yuli - and the group comforts her by asking her about sushi.
### Continuing the hunt
the group decides to follow the specific sliding monster and we manage to keep those tracks - on another roll we see if we can keep the tracks of the other beasts. with that roll
- the first track of the clawed footprint is identifiable
- the hoof prints are identifiable
- the displacer beast tracks are identifiable
- the paws without claws are not as fresh
- the sliding track is not as fresh 
the hoof prints are about as big as the displacer beasts paws, and the other set of paws are smaller than the hooves 
#### The Hunt
The group attempts to identify the hoof prints and we identify them as swine with a nature check from Yuli. The swine prints also seem to be multiple sets of prints. After this because we are so close to the beast the group will roll against it rolling perception investigation and then survival.
We succeed our perception check and enter deeper into thicker woods, our investigation check barely passes revealing some brownish gray fur caught in the thicket. 
We follow it to find a dug through underneath the thicket - after going though we reach a clearer section of the woods we realize its a large pack of pigs. At this point we identify them as giant boar and mars cast locate animals or plants we close in on them while sneaking.
We know that these beasts will respond to threats on their territory and we may have to fight them in wetlands - we are going to try to lure them to an area with some tree cover . 
### Looting & End of Session
We survived the encounter with Yuli and Thom going down - mars and Thom found unbreakable arrows in the hide of the biggest boss boar and gave them to Albrecht. 
The group figured out how to haul the boar corpses back to the tavern and rested for the night.
