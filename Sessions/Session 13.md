### Beginning of Notes
We begin the session by immediately turning around and asking [[Benedict Cleabes]] to scry on [[The Handler]] for us, he sees " the beautiful red curls and a tall silhouette and there is someone two the side but they are muffled and I cant tell who or what they are the handler seems to be on a smooth tile stone floor that could be worn old cobblestone, they seem to be walking through large rooms or hallways and then into large rooms again and as the spell is ending he sees a blue mist" He says the blue mist seems king of souls-like that is like sundered torn apart souls. 
the very wealthy nobles in this area fear the cleave immensely and the handler is sort of grasped at the opportunity to turn that fear into motivation for their own plans. The handler is blackmailing the nobles and mugging everyone else.
The handler has had smaller events or gatherings in the past but never a gala, [[Benedict Cleabes]] has not gone to them in the past because he was aware that nobles were being blackmailed and did not want any part of that. 
[[The Teal Basilisk]] is a statue of [[Rytus]] across from the statue there is a semicircle tavern building called [[Cliff of the Winery]]. It's packed with some of the most upper class citizens of [[Esa Themar]] while there we approach the huge bar and listen to the conversations happening around us. Some citizens are talking about the gala and that they are excited but nervous, they are excited to get dressed up and that the handler is a interesting and exciting figure. 

internally on a detect thoughts their thoughts are i cannot believe I have to appease this and go to this event, very much I don't want to go and have to do this - the reasoning behind it is because they believe their son was taken by the handler or persuaded into abandoning.

The person that is looking forward to it is a drow individual in gorgeous garments they are dressed in  a beautiful robe-pant suit, they are drow but they are gender-non conforming they are dark skinned with very dark black hair.

The other person is a stout halfling whose face has no remarkable features apart from their chin having a short grey tufted beard.

While sitting at the bar a female half elf comes over and asks if we would like anything to drink, they are about as tall as thom and they are bald pale with red eyes - upon probing them about the people in the bar they suggest that the nobles all here are gathering in preparation for the gala. Behind the bartender is a animated chair that follows them around.

[[Esa Themar]] is pushing [[Zul]], [[Esa Themar]] gets all its goods by sea and is able to give 

[[Clay]] looks for [[Wesley]]'s extended family. 
[[Meara Voltemand]] looks for aasimar and doesn't see anyone.
[[Thom]] looks for humans, and there is one - [[Clay]] drinking in the corner. 
[[Yuli]] looks for moon elves, and while there are a few they don't look like yuli - they have different eyes, hair and facial features.

We leave the tavern and decide to go look for rooms at a place we can afford, we find another tavern near the edge of town called [[grasping vines]].

large cottage structure with warm lighting and wooden construction many many plants blooming on the exterior and interior 
burnt golden skin and eyes short muscular he offers us 3 rooms, on investigating him we notice 3 things, on his left hand he has a brand on his hand that kind of looks like a dragon head turned to the side, he has a ton of jewelry on like rings and bracelets that are pretty cheaply made, and when he buffs up his shirt slightly opens revealing a leaf. 

Yuli decides to go back and see [[Cliffton DeBolbec]], the owner of the tavern,  and he recognizes yuli as she approaches Yuli recognizes them as someone who would have been on one of their ships. Yuli asks if he is safe here and he says yes because of Yuli and Yuli's crew he was able to start his new life. 
Yuli asks where they originally came from and if they could share any information now that she could not have asked

He came from a poor family in [[Esa Minor]] and wanted a better life and heard about the prosperity in keenton and then took a pilgrimage there and was there for many years before yuli was able to get him out. Yuli asks if he knows if anyone else made it out ok, he says yes and that they have spread out and that some are in [[Esa Themar]] and that they are easy enough to spot with the brand as it never goes away. Yuli says she left and that her dad has many people still  helping any way they can but against his wishes she left home and is trying to make sure that she can take care of the issue and that he would never have to go back 'there' again. He says just remember life is a long journey and you'll get there when its time while looking at the brand on his hand. He points behind him and says this is because you saved me so let me return this to you and gives yuli back the 5 gp we paid for our rooms. 

Yuli asks because he is here if he heard anything about the handler, he says she's bullied all around town and has the backing of the nobles and its hard for anyone on the lower levels to do anything other than keep their heads down and keep their businesses running, there are rumors of blackmail and taking of male children. Yuli says she's helped him before and is determined to help her again. After returning to the party she is visibly emotional ,upon giving clay the money back he asks about the brand. Yuli explains that the brand is from keenton , a small icy city north of [[Mount Bane]] and bane coast , that worships the diety there is also named keenton a very old dragon. they have enslaved and captured many people that 'the bad people' were the ones enslaving those people and that those who escaped fled to bane coast to her family because they have an underground system where they smuggle them on boats to a be able to start their new lives. 
[[Meara Voltemand]] asks if [[Suka Orin]] is the leader of the slave ring or? Yuli says her mom gave her this note [[Letter From Sora]], once she became familar with the handler and the bandits of zul she obviously wanted to help but makes sure we know we have more that needs to be done.
Thom pulls yuli aside after the rest of the party goes to bed and apologizes for being hostile to them in the beginning and that they are doing things for a good reason. 
### the next day
Yuli brings up the leaf on his shirt - its a vine common in the [[Themar Wilds]]. There is nothing super abnormal, it is just weird that its growing out of his chest. He remembers it as far back as Keenton and after cutting it off the leaf quickly withers withers but we cast gentle repose on it and put it in a vile. He seems to have memory loss similar to mars. 
We decide to figure more out later as it doesnt seem to be hurting himi

middle aged stout halfling with a bald head and black eyes with smooth sunburnt pink skin - likely from spending alot of time at the water, he is only about 3 foot 4in and has a diamond shaped face, while 
[[dassos clothing emporium]] he introduces himself as [[Daso Chilly]] while coming over to us and tripping over himself. he has a small hand puppet of an elf in a three piece suit named mr riggins 

#### on our way to honey hall
we head to the eastern edge of town where the road begins to turn into fields and trees there are less and less people around and the buildings seem to be boarded up and dilapidated   after albrecht investigates the area and is sure we are at [[Honey Hall]] an arrow is shot at yuli but she catches it and then 3 lizardfolk and a tortle come out to meet us. The main lizard asks us why we are here and Yuli replies that they are looking for someone, specifically [[Suka Orin]] and that its for something very important - then the tortle (named Jim with pointey green scales and a brown shell with a cheek piercing and a peglegged right foot.) drasisks (the lizard folk) what do you think is in it for us what do you think we could get out of it. Do you think you have anything for us ? we ask what they would need and they say that some supplies have been stolen from them that were worth a lot, specifically a crate - I liked it better when i could pay off the merchants to have things moved instead of having to do it himself. Suka used to run things around here but she left about a year ago and she trained all of them- if your looking for practical guidance she's the best , he also says she left on a 'expedition' upon asking for a description he says he would give the description and the rest of the information upon the return of the crate- and its contents. The create will be marked with a honeycomb. 
[[Meara Voltemand]] gets their ring enchanted to be able to have another disguise to wear to the party. We then head to [[Esa Manor]] we decide to go on a forested hill that lets us look down on the maor and if we approach the cliff we can look down but risk being seen by the people at the manor but if we back up we are well hidden. 
its a very tall building set on the hillside, with a large watchtower to the right thats attached to the building with the main building going to the left with a main tower in the middle of the building, its similar to the construction of the buildings in esa themar with cobblestone base walls, wooden siding Mars was seen as a owl so plays it safe and only gets vague details. Thom's familar approaches a window and sees a giant ballroom with columns flanking either side with space behind them to middle but at the far end in the middle of the room there are a bunch of doors that open up. In the ballroom there are people setting up for the event being ordered around by the drow we saw in esa themar

in a secluded internal balcony tucked away we can see a figure with beautiful red hair talking to someone. 

the main entrance, a back entrance that goes up to the back balcony, a entrance that goes to the watchtower and then connects to the tower, the last thing I see some basement doors off the left side of the manor. we end the session with
