### Beginning of Notes
we begin the session by going through the door and entering combat after defeating them we see that we are in a brig of sorts with cages lining the walls, there are prisoners in the cells that contain rapidly shifting prisoners boar and person, a tiger and a person, a vulture and a person, a rat and a person. We believe that the healing factor used by [[Scaletail]] is likely a successful coming from these experiments or of these trials. We discern that a greater restoration or a wish spell could heal them but we don't have access to those spells right now so we say a prayer and continue to explore. 
We find a coffin filled with money (400cp 570sp 350gp) and has a infernal inscription on the side of it , flanked by two demonic statues.

We find a private worship chamber and notice the benches are glowing a slight warm orange, and inside there is a little statue at the front depicting a little cup with a little imp on it , inside which is a scroll and 2 boxes of ammunition ( 20 of each crossbow bolts and arrows both of which are silver tipped ) the scroll is a scroll of revivify!

As we have been going through the dungeon we have felt a heavy presence that has only grown stronger - we feel it very strongly here in the private chamber. 

In another room we find rows of bench's that lead up to a We find a statue of [[Vesh]] raising his hand with a bone devil at their feet like a pet - the statue is new - much newer than most of the other dungeon. The statue is a praising statue to [[vesh]] and the bone devil is odd because usually it would just focus on the deity not include other worshippers. We feel like it could be a sign that the bone devil is close to or even is the handler - while we are investigating the room we hear the sounds of chanting and a scream as if to suggest a sacrifice has been made nearby. 

We go to the final room we have yet to enter and clay kicks the door down. The chanting is in infernal and has become incredibly loud we cannot understand what is being said but we see five nobles surrounding a pit of blue swirling souls coming out of it - the same thing we saw in the scry. To the left we see a table with a sacrificed wereboar still shifting in death with blood pouring down the sacrifice table. Everyone in the room is still chanting and has not stopped, we see VO the drow and [[The Handler]] are also here in the room.

We hear the handler say *Posess* and souls come out of the blue well in the room and souls enter the bodies of the nobles in the room - they shed there mortal beings and become imps and VO sheds their skin to become a bearded devil. They cast a poison spray cloud after feeling a focus under their clothes.

resistant to blugeoning piercing slashing damage that is not silvered resistance to cold damage immune to poison / cannot be poisoned and fire damage
after we defeat vo we see their soul return to the well and we hear the handler telepathically say in our heads vesh will rise the hells have foretold it you cannot end us here. 

on dying the handler says vesh i give my being to thee and the entire ash of the form goes inot the well of souls in the middle of the room
