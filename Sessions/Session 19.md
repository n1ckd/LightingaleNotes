### Beginning of Notes
We begin the session with [[Benedict Cleabes]] and [[Vanya]] as cleabes is preparing to break her curse, trying lesser restoration, then greater restoration.
during the greater restoration as the spell is cast the room lights up with bright white light. 
In the light [[Thom]] sees a vision of icy caverns that dig deeper and deeper, shards of ice that fly past, a giant clawed hand that reaches forward and scrapes until it breaks through into a cavern that the creature then falls into the 50 ft cavern, then looks up to see a white haired women who was in the cavern.
As the vision ends and the light fades Thom sees [[Vanya]] looking at her hands and to [[Benedict Cleabes]] and then in a weak voice thanks him. 

[[Vanya]] says she can use her voice again and that she has not been able to use it in very long - her mother hid her away and in the few years she was hidden she was able to learn to read and speak before being discovered and suffering the same curse as her mother.

[[Thom]] asks [[Benedict Cleabes]] if he saw the vision of the monster in the cave - he did not and he says its not something he has experienced before but he has also not done much curse-breaking either. The library for the school is south east of Cleabes' house. [[Meara Voltemand]] suggests visiting spa and the library with [[Vanya]].

The rest of the party [[Mars]], [[Yuli]], [[Albrecht]], [[Clay]] are going to [[Honey Hall]] to deliver the crate that we agreed to get for the thieves there. While on the way there we notice [[Clay]] has something on his mind but we leave it alone for now.

[[Draksis]] (the lizardfolk who was shot last time we were here) steps out with a bandage across his chest and a crossbow pointed to us- Then [[Yuli]] makes shows them the shard of the crate we found - then [[Draksis]] tells us to come inside - as we enter the dilapidated building we see that in the ruined dirty buildings are tunnels that connect all the nearby buildings to discretely move around the area - there are shady characters sitting in the shadows, following them through these areas for a few minutes brings us to what is likely the remains of the church - there is iconography to a lot of the normal pantheon of gods like [[Rytus]] and a collection of a lot of other gods presumably for communities to come and worship different deities. 
We come to a treasure horde of sorts with [[Gem]] the peg legged tortle sitting with lizard folk waiting in the rafters of the church above us. [[Yuli]] is waived over to talk to [[Gem]] and they have a long conversation in thieves cant 

Like I said [[Suka Orin]] left about a year ago the trade for honey hall had sort of slowed and we were looking for bigger and better opportunities - Suka became fixated on a opportunity in the west. we spent months working to get a pass for her to cross to the west beacon , she intends to be an expeditioner - someone who wants to enter [[The Cleve]] for quite a lot of money - but expeditioners generally don't come back. 
She is an excellent rogue and is hard to find when she doesn't want to be found keep an eye out for a white cat - a Tabaxi.  
The corvid or raven symbol we had been using from Yuli's coin is a calling card of [[Suka Orin]]. We also learn that [[Yuli]] and [[Albrecht]] originally got the corvid coin from a white Tabaxi that offered them the chance to gamble before meeting [[Mars]]. 

We reconvene in the city and [[Yuli]] is very happy to see [[Vanya]] is doing well. We learn that [[Vanya]] is only 15 and was born in the manor - she has never known 

ms.Commonbrooke a kind small half elf short wavey blonde hair and green eyes greets us at the bathhouse and we all enter some baths mars goes into his own, clay and albrecht enter one and yuli, meara, and vanya enter one. 
### Library Time
After the bathhouse we head to the library in [[Esa Themar]] town to use libraries we can use investigation, intelligence, or perception checks - 

Thom looks for books on creatures from ice environments, folklore from northern cultures, and books on curse breaking. 
- is seeing a vision a known side effect of curse breaking? ->there is no specific thing that relays that its something experienced by others but the book is more focused on the instruction of curse breaking apart from some notes on rituals and weird things happening during those rituals - but not specifically what thom experienced. 
- I'm looking for depictions of similar monsters to the hints from the vision-> there are only a few tunneling ice borough creatures and they are all pretty big, there are no small ones because they need a lot of strength.
- Thom is looking for white haired women specifically from [[Winters Refuge]]->there is an ancient folk story that ties back to [[Rytus]] himself. When [[Rytus]] existed as a being in the world he would stay in Rytus's temple and was known to have an attendant - a beautiful women with white hair as described and she was known as [[The Oracle]] she was known to provide insight to those who sought guidance and was strongly bonded and imbued with Rytuses enormous powers. In the story this is what was known to exist long ago but the fate of the oracle is unknown. 
Yuli is looking for books on [[Bahamut]]
- what makes someone a good or a bad person from this religions perspective? the nuance between the two etc -> in general religions are based around a set of rules and guidance the silver dragon as bahamut is commonly known is about strict following of the honor and justice of the laws of the land. there is direct tie to order over chaos , the importance of structure and civilization, there are carve outs for the need for warfare or fighting so this religion is not passive. It is solitary based on the laws you are governed by the religion wants you to recognize where you are and be lawful / be a good patron citizen / person in your community.
- What makes a good or bad person in the culture of keenton it is a very poor impoverished desolate town that is cold uncomfortable and soggy, the book references a religion there and it is a key reason for why the people get through the shitty conditions. there are no remarks of slavery and the god of the religion is perfectly fine aligning to neutral or lawful good - it defiantly doesn't match what Yuli knows. 
- Yuli wants to learn more about people like her?-> Your looking for more information on moon elves and within a book brought to you- the attendant who is a fairly learned person has shifted to being more in awe in Yuli, approaching them with a look of wonder. As you flip through the pages you come across a section called the vampire clans. There are clans listed from the east as well as clans listed from the west, in the west there are four clans and in the east there are four as well. "The Sea clan, once living at the pinnacle of - desecrated by the [[Kundek]]" is all that remains of a subtly ripped or cut out page.
Clay is asking for picture books or manga's or something
- Clays manga is so good its about a lone samurai guy who goes on some wacky ass adventures- he is always sorta like getting into very strange and out of place situations like creatures coming out of the ground in town etc. Clay asks How people in that world perceive that character ? -> with a sense of awe but a underlying feeling of fear. 
- In the story the samurai takes a path of exile, and distances himself from his family and friends and by the third book has wrapped back to his hometown and is no longer recognized.
- in book four there is this decision within the samurai character does he try to reconnect with his family and his father who is very dear to him, or does he choose to let them move on without him - clay looks like he is about to throw up.
Meara is asking for books on lesser idols of the pantheon.
- Is there any additional information on the [[Archivist]]? -> a lesser idol known to religious studies as a choosey diety the research points to the archivist choosing people to follow him not people choosing to follow the archivist. It also points to an unknown space there is something that exists on another plane that is related to this diety, nothing material that anyone has been able to put together at this point. The content on the archivist seems to be written in a neutral tone with maybe a slight bit of patination they aren't doing anything bad but maybe should be monitored - for a deity to be selective is interesting. 
- Spells and specifically enchantment spells - specifically ones that can mess with someone's memories or control a person?-> she finds a book listing charm person, modify memory, wish, etc.

Albrecht is looking for books on [[Vesh]] and almost something else (but doesn't because he seems scared to say it) but then says any similar entities associated. 
- Albrecht wants to look for any pieces or artifacts of vesh?-> vesh is kind of lumped in with a group of lesser idols, there is a section on vesh, vecna deserate and a few otherse who are known to put essence or influence into various objects or statues as ways for them to make themselves known on the material plane without being exposed to the dangers of the material plane. it is a fairly common demonic practice for higher tiered demons. This could be to gain power through the usage of it, to connect with a particular person or thing or area - there is a myriad of reasons depending on the entity. 
- Does it say anything about the people who encounter these things? it depends on the intent behind the item - but generally people are able to either move away from the connect to the item at a certain point and it can be more or less influence depending on the item and its strength etc. 
- What about destroying them?-> to destroy an item it depends on what the item is made out of and you would need a way to dispel or overpower the essence within - for lesser demons that could be as simple as dispelling magic or much more complicated. 
- Albrecht is going to look for folkloric creatures from where Albrecht is from they are looking for 'it'. One of the biggest stand outs is the abomdiable yetis or yeti-kin that live in the tribal regions, there is the cobolt clans that also live in the tribal regions. There are story and tells of giant eagle like birds with 50ft wingspans that come off the mountains to hunt. There are tales of the packs of wolves that hunt layers and layers thick, worms known to breech the surface and the sort of wintery like lost souls of people in the region are known as sorrow-sworn that are sort of stuck in the dimensional planes and roam the area. There is towards the end tales of an enormous being of element and draconic nature that has only been witnessed once or twice - but there is no real understanding of what that being was.  The most you get about it are the sightings both happened around the winters refuge mountain - the giant mountain at the northern end of the [[Richland Mountain Range]] the largest snowcapped mountain in the range - its known to have some sort of mystical or magical properties. On the last page as you are closing the book there is a hand written note on the back page "multiple reports of a shifting being never fully spotted or understood but multiple sightings near the [[Frost Pines]]." This book was written by the master of necromancy [[Rine galbolg]] at the [[Discovery School of Magic]] in [[Winters Refuge]].

Mars is asking for books on parasitic plants, flora of themar wilds, and 
- Mars finds in the back of the book a section on underdark and related flora and fauna in the themar wilds. There is a connection to the underdark within the forest somewhere I find a page specifically referencing the same kind of mushrooms that are attached to me - it points to a very hyper-poisonings rapid growth mushroom that seems to be somewhere in-between parasitic and host (defiantly draining in some way) There is not a lot of research for habitat or growth patterns or anything but it is believed that they could grow rapidly if left unchecked and without competition. 
- I find a page about the plant that was growing in the olive garden guy and finds about the same information as before that it is a very common plant in the wilds. 
- Mars wants to know more about firbolgs, he finds that they are quite common and that there are quite a few clans known in the east and there are some clans in the west as well- the book mentions that there is a nomadic clan that travels [[Glades of the Gale]] to perfrom rituals and ceremonies around the glades that function as a protective ritual
- there is a perimant clan that lives in the talking grove- they are known to be very very connected to plant life in particular and they have developed many methods of communication with plants.
- the second clan is a wandering clan that is very hostile which is very odd for firbolgs because generally firbolgs are more gentle and respectful but not much
- lives in the areas surrounding the golden grasslands and lives in the area near gold maldir they span that channel and are known to be very passive - they are not perminatly sheltered but stay to that area herding livestock and around the area.

After Yuli is frustrated at the ripped out page describing the sea elves, Albrecht reads the page - Albrecht seems to recognize something in the page and asks Yuli what drew them to the page in the first place - while Yuli cant put her finger on it she believes its important to her. Albrecht says the Kundek is a vampire clan, they are like the overlords of other vampires, I'm not really sure what information is torn out or why and gets a little nervous as they realize it could have been done to intentionally hide something, as they flip the page 
the vonsturben clan a clan in the Richland range above the golden grasslands they are seen as reclusive and docile in politics they are not interested in the position of vampire lord and they are content with the space they have.  The clan is completely comprised of aarakocra. After Yuli and Albrecht come back inside after exchanging looks Albrecht looks like he just got done throwing up in a way - there is still something on his mind that is making him uncomfortable but Yuli and him came to some sort of understanding, Yuli is waking really close to Albrecht not only is there no animosity but there is a even more closeness than before with hints of concern. Yuli insights the attendant and he seems to be in awe at what he has realized Yuli is - he says he received the book from the collection on [[bane coast]] I think this is how it came but he is not sure and he will try and follow up on it. Yuli asks why they are looking at her like that - he apologizes and says he didn't mean to be rude but he has never seen a real moon elf before - at first glance I thought you were a sea elf - which is much more common than a moon elf and Yuli has come to the understanding that she is probably been getting perceived as a sea elf with odd features. She

Sea elves live primarily in the city of teanua in the west beacon, on a island to the south west of the east beacon, there is currently a internal conflict going on between the elves who lived in sathass and now live in city of new sathass and the sea elves. 

After we leave the library we head to [[Grasping Vines]] to see [[Cliffton DeBolbec]] and he welcomes us in but has to charge us this time as his half elf wife is giving us a look from the doorway behind him. Albrecht mentions to Yuli that he could have braided her hair if she needed it this time. 
Mars and Clay spend the night together sharing interests as mars goes through his favorite ingredients and plants. 
Meara and Vanya share a room with Vanya and notices that she has some rough fingertips- not callouses but something different.
