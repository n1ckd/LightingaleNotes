### Start of the Hunt
The hunt has to be contained to the forest.
Our first Survival check showed us tracks of 
- a large clawed pawprint
- a large hoof print
- two sets of tracks walking in tandem of two large beasts walking with claws -we identified as a displacer beast
- two sets of tracks with large paws without claws
- two sets of reptilian like claws with a large slide - the sliding is where the beast comes out of the ground and slides back under the feet have three toes and have claws but whatever the beast is its big.
#### Merchant encounter
During our tracking we failed to stealth past a group of two elven merchant, a horse drawn carriage - clay recognizes them as part of the [[Merchants Guild]] who reported the presence of bandits shaking people down to the south. One of the bandits has a tiger.
#### Tracking
The first day we identify and track the displacer beasts.
The second day we attempt to identify the sliding tracks and follow them. While following them we decide to setup camp for the night using the same watch order as the previous night.

### Attacked in the Night
Yuli and Albrecht are attacked during their watch by 3 humans, they are surprised and clubbed Albrecht manages to scare two of them off while Yuli firebolts one in the face killing them. 
The party wakes up to Yuli scared hiding in a bush and after curing her wounds the party moves to another nearby site that is covered where the party was able to setup an alarm were able to rest for the night.
The attackers seemed like they were not much of a threat as they were very weak and attacked with mostly sticks, we managed to get one of their wallets but could not identify them as Yuli had fireballed them in the face.
