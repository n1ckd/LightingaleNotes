## Session Notes
After waking up the morning after our encounter with the boars we plan how to carry 4 large boar carcasses and one large boss boar to haul back to Tyr's Tankard we are having 5 horses ride back and 3 of them carry the 5 boars.
The draft horses are worn away skeletal horses that have a muscular structure that look like merry go round horses. Yuli and Albrecht double up while everyone else takes a horse back.
On the way back we roll to identify tracks and see
#### Continuing The Hunt
- the first clawed footprint track is easily picked up
- the displacer beast tracks are easily identifiable 11-15
- the paw tracks are easily identifiable
- the sliding track is identifiable
The group chooses to identify the first clawed track and identified it as a tiger. This would likely belong to the bandits the tiger tracks lead south/ south west, the displacer tracks lead north east, the paw tracks lead north west, the slide tracks lead south east.
The group brands each of the boar behind the ear with Yuli's raven coin.  We decided to travel back to Tyr Tankard to return with our trophy kills -especially now that we are aware of bandits that are in the near woods. 

The Hill we were ambushed on is called [[Constellation Hill]] and its known as one of the smaller waypoints in the Themar wilds. We decided to camp out about 30 minutes from the road in a very well hidden site. 
#### Nights Watch
We decided to change out the sleep order to be Yuli Mars , Yuli Clay, Ari and Albrecht.
Mars makes  a tea to stay awake by foraging some ginseng roots to make a caffeinated tea to help them stay awake. Mars and Yuli address good vs evil and self defense, Mars also adds a print of the raven coin to his bestiary. 
Yuli and Clay talk about Clay's family and his past, while Ari and Albrecht talk about Albrechts monster form, their past as a hunter and Ari's patron the [[Archivist]].
#### The Next Day 
The party comes across a caravan of a wood elf and two half elves who seem to sell potions. We trade 3 of the smaller boars for a crate of 6 health potions. We take the 6 tusks as proof of kill. We reach Zul by the end of day. 
#### End of day
The party comes to [[Tyr Tankard]] and gets extra gold (60pcs per character for 2 boar) and we decided to contact the merchant guild to try and get to the bottom of our surprise attack in the night by what appears to be guild members - we can also ask about the bandit situation and maybe gain reputation.
