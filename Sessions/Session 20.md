### Beginning of Notes
We walk out of the library and sell some of our goodies, mainly Mars's tapestries and Yuli's coral. We find ourselves in [[Raven's Briar]] and as we head away from the [[The Teal Basilisk]] and head to the [[Merchants Guild]] in [[Esa Themar]] behind the desk is a short male aasimar with silvery hair that has been died teal, blue eyes, and rough white skin - about 6ft 4in with a pretty average build. He has a sort of square face and moves nimbly behind his desk. we present [[Wanted_Poster.pdf]] and [[The Handler]]'s chunk of hair. His mouth drops and immediately isn't sure if he believes us. He immediately takes the ledger we got from him and slides it behind his desk, which we try to talk him against doing. He bolts with the leger after we push him to give it back to us and we try and stop him with mars pulling him back with a thorn whip, Meara and Yuli getting the leger back. Albrecht transforms into their monster form (griffon front half is bird and spine shape is hyena and dog back legs, with a humanoid shape kind of like a centaur and a dog, the skin on him is rotting) , crushing the aasimar in the doorframe - killing him. His body begins to slowly dissipate into ash similar to how to [[The Handler]]'s body and minions died.  

On his body we find a merchants guild id for [[Ilan rowntree]], and in the backroom there is a shipping order in a ledger for one [[Suka Orin]] - a shipment a little over two months ago for her to travel to [[High Tarum]] 

the names [[Kundek]] make an appearance in the [[Handler's Ledger]] as well as [[Virion]] aka VO but not much information is gained on them.
### Shopping in Esa Themar
we go shopping to the blacksmith a large building marked by various cages clanging on the outer walls- each filled with a different little creature the blacksmith is called [[The Smoking Gourd]], The first creature we notice is a [[Giant Fly]], female half elf runs the store - she has short curly blonde hair with reddish amber eyes soft golden skin, she is about 6ft 1in shes pretty muscular with a oval shaped face and she is slightly bowlegged. 
named for the early usage for the hooks that used to bring items up the cliffside face that has now been replaced by the elevator , this area has now become the meeting place for a rich group of a hunting club that hunts the biggest and most impressive game in the nearby wilds deGrey's [[Rusted Hooks]] a three story warehouse building that has been turned into a lounge a 30 yr old female human with long braided hair and brown eyes with smooth pinkish red skin she is 4ft 9in and is a little chubby - her face is very squared and she is missing her right arm, where her arm ends she has a book that she is writing in with her remaining arm. [[Velma deGrey]] is the shopkeeper - she has various containers to hold water in, inks , flasks, and a variety of tools. If you buy a tool set and practice with it and complete 5 tools you will be proficient in the tool
- carpenter
- cobbler
- cook utensil
- glass blower

Velma warns us about the residents of the nearby hunting lounge "Human to human, they aren't great the people in the lodge do a lot of killing of not necessarily such bad beasts in the forest."
### Returning to Ravens Briar
we head back to the middle of town to [[Raven's Briar]] near the side of the [[The Discovery Campus in Esa Themar]] we find a small shack that is leaning against the building neck to it - it has a small sign hanging from it that says [[collectible oddities]] a well lit ballroom is inside with warmly light magical fire - as we walk in we see a young goliath with a bald head with fancy tattoos covering his body with silky golden skin, he is 7ft 1in he is fairly skinny for a goliath and has quadruple piercings in his left eyebrow. With his southern accent he introduces himself as  [[Fort shaker]]- he has scrolls weird shit, weapons armor etc. 

Yuli and albrecht get enchanted 1+ added to their bows and cross bows, clay got a vicious trident, thom go a elemental gem.

Thoms mothers name is [[Yiraclayda Adele]] and offers a deal with [[Fort shaker]] to get a discount for the figurine of wonderous power onyx dog statue.
