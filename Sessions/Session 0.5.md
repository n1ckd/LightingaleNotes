# Session Notes

The [[The Party]] of strangers comes together near the [[Places/Forests/Themar Wilds]] outside of [[Zul]].
Starting with Mars's experiences he travels farther south than he has yet to travel in the wilds. He is pursuing a [[Faerie Dragon]] to catalog it in his Bestiary. Travelling this far south has had Mars reach the mountains that have always bordered the southern side of the wilds - the [[Richland Mountain Range]]. Finally passing to the south side of the range he has come across a road where he hears voices, ready to observe and record Mars sneaks through the trees in an attempt to identify the source of the voices.
- Mars then meets Yuli the Moon Elf and Albrecht the Arakocra who are on their way to Zul from the south side of the Richland mountains. 
- In the Themar wilds we find 3 flowers types
	- blue flowers can be consumed to regain a level one spell slot
	- green flowers are bad / poisonous
	- red flowers restore health
- Mars tries salmon for the first time giving Yuli a Goodberry in return. Mars is uncomfortable as he has never been this exposed / travelled open roads. 
- While travelling we come across a elf dressed in a robe heading south from where we came. the elf is apart of the [[Discovery School of Magic]] in Zul and he offers teleportation in exchange for money to purchase some spellcasting supplies. 
- The terrain we pass is mostly rolling grass hills dotted with trees, with forests to the left and glistening beautiful water nearby. 
- We take a route through the woods and eventually we are descended upon by a fog that knocks us unconscious. During this time unconscious we all see flashes of images in our dreams.
- Mars's receives [[dream_0]] from the fog. And upon waking up we are all back to where we met the elf loosing a day and a half of travel. 
- After receiving these dreams Albrecht is notably unsettled when going to bed - but they play it off.
- When making camp near the hills that border of Zul Mars and Albrecht notice a campfire a few hills over towards the wilderness. Yuli failed a steal check when approaching a campsite of four halflings cooking a boar they are friendly and share their meal with us. 
- Getting closer to Zul we hear an noise similar to the sound of an air raid siren. -> this is a sign of teleportation to the area. 
- Mars, Yuli, and Albrecht all enter the [[Tyr Tankard]] where they are sat across from two humans(dante & guin)and a barmaid (maya) serves us our ale.
- Tom is looking for a person named [[Benedict Cleabes]] that Yuli recognizes.
- Yuli is looking for [[Suka Orin]]
- We are convinced by Ari to compete in a monster hunting competition being run by the barkeep [[Fin]] .
