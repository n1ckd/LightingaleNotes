### Beginning of Notes
After we defeat the handler and their ashes have returned to the well, 

Thom finds a scroll of infestation, a locked wooden box, and a sheet of paper that as Thom touches it the paper with a symbol and some writing on it but it starts to burn away a large diamond within a circle with two weapons crossing in the middle with a crossbow and an axe. Clay mentions it's [[bounty hunter symbol]]. It is a piece of paper that would have allowed the handler to put a bounty on someone - we don't know the requirements of these papers and they are fairly rare - we recognize the symbol but we don't know the true name of the co op. We do know that it came from the [[West Beacon]] and was smuggled somehow. 
Inside the locked wooden box we see a rock with a face carved into it with the mouth open and the eyes closed. We assume its a sending stone - and its out of charges meaning it was used today but should regain a charge tomorrow. 
Mars upon using detect magic mars sees the stone light up, the scroll light up, a jar on the floor where VO turned to ash and in the back of the room in the hallway I see multiple things glowing, as well as the table to the left of the door. The stone is of the evocation school of magic. 
We investigate the remains of the nobles / imps and find nothing other than ash.
Upon investigating VO we find gold jewelry for a combined worth of 1200gp, a magical jar with keoghtom's ointment 6 doses in it , we also find a identification Virion Olotoris. Olotoris is a family name of one of the founding tribes 

The elven council is formed by the 3 elven tribes the [[Olotoris]] the [[Sarxina]] and the [[Torfir Tribe]] its a 5 member group of males and females and they have a rotating structure, the term of the council is 100 years with only death o early retirement being the reasoning for it being cut off. Some key things about this is the Olotoris tribe does not have  a member on the council because many of there members died in a  accident and are next up to replace someone on the council. Virion was not the next person to be named but was about four down as far as the family goes the [[Olotoris]] for their tribe the next person [[Athtar Olotoris]] (male) after them is [[Jaonas]] (male) [[Renna]](female) [[Virion]] (male) Faylen()

The accident for the [[Olotoris]] tribe is very shrouded from the public eye and was widely accepted to be a sad event.

Yuli opens a chest with 10 coral worth 100gp each so 1000gp total, as well as 800cp 9000sp 2200gp 100plat per person that's 694gp 10sp, as well as 4 potions of healing, a potion of climbing, and a spell scroll. The spell scroll is for false life.

Mars (after some difficulty) is able to unlock the other chest with the set of keys he found off the guard. Inside it he finds some tapestries (5x 250 gp each) a magical swimming ring, a potion of animal friendship and a bag of holding which mars keeps, after checking if anything is in it. 
Clay find a case of +1 crossbow bolts that will go to Yuli, along with the potion of animal friendship. A wooden potion rack with 3 potions in it the potions are a clear liquid with green swirls in it, within one we see a cut boar ear, a tigers ear, and in the last one we see a vultures beak Mars keeps these potions and they are the Unstable Potions of Were in his inventory. We find the crate we were looking from [[Honey Hall]] that was apart of our deal to get information on [[Suka Orin]] - inside which seems to be some chains and collars / shackles. We decide to set up in the chapel room and we manage to sleep through the night and proceed into the prisoner room and find many of the unspoken servants and were-person experiments dead amongst many guards dead. Meara burns the body of the unspoken servant that she was trying to help earlier. Yuli finds a chunk of the handlers red curly hair that we could use as proof. As we backtrack out of the dungeon we go back to the one room we missed where we get hit by a trap, find a chest with a leger and a infernal tome named 'demon lords' we follow bloody footprints up and into the main hall and search the rest of the manor only finding statues of [[Vesh]] and dresses belonging to the handler (thom and meara both .
