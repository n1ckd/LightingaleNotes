## Busting into the Temple
The party bursts into the temple and immediately kills one of the bandits, then tiger claw steps on top of a wooden platform in the back of the room where he shouts "kill the intruders!" as we kicked the shit out of them killing both tiger claw and the tiger as it was trying to run out. 
## Looting the temple
- Clay finds 5x citrine (50 gp each) , 2 platinum & a [[map with handwritten notes]] on it and a [[Handler Support Letter]] directed to the [[The Handler]].
- Yuli finds 5x star rose quartz, padded leather armor & scimitar as well as 5x daggers & a magic wand (wand of lightning bolts) in the bottom of a chest 
- Ari finds 6x azurite, 1400 silver pieces, 2300 copper pieces, and a piece of paper stuffed into a [[note in a bandit tent]]   
- Mars finds 10x rations 100ft of silk rope 80 gp, and a case which yuli opens and finds 2 magic scrolls one scroll for sleep and one for jump.
## Planning 
Mars strung 2 humans, five half elves, 2 elves , and a halfling, and tiger claw is a half elf and makes a necklace of the removed ears to turn in as proof of bounty.
