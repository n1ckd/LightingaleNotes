## Session Notes
### Beginning of Notes
Thom received the message from [[Benedict Cleabes]] saying to come visit in [[Esa Themar]], finding out that we are in the lead for the monster hunting competition we decide to accompany Thom to meet Benedict Cleabes - even thought they are not very forthcoming about why they need to see them and who they are. We summon our draft horses and end our travel by the lone tree outside of [[Zul]]. 

We continue out into the [[Themar Wilds]] and the weather turns sour as its quite cold and raining , something uncommon for the area. along the side of the road there is a sort of supply depot, mainly a few crates, that trail into a bushed area , they are tumbled and broken and seem to have been left behind - we believe that they were drooped by people carrying them while moving them and they seem to contain rations, mars sees anywhere from 4-10 sets of prints and clay sees that the crates are marked with the sigil of [[Scaletail]]. Upon following the crates beyond the bush-line we find a stashed crate containing 20gp each, a potion of greater healing, and a parchment [[Partial Map of Themar Wilds]] that we haven't seen yet. 

The next day we continue and the weather improves, the wind at our backs lets us gain a day of travel on our journey to Esa Themar.
We find shelter by a rocky outcropping in an area and as we camp Ari decides to say that they need to apologize because they have been lying to us - Ari Feldwynn is a character, Zul had become their safe haven and as we are leaving Ari decides to take off her ring of deception to reveal an Aasimar, she bows and introduces herself [[Meara Voltemand]] - the person in the [[Voltemand Wanted Poster]].

Yuli reveals that she left home because her dad was very overprotective and controlling so she left on the advice of her mother to go explore and find people to adventure with. 
### Onward with Meara
We continue on our trip to the next day and we are met by a fallen section of trees and are forced to dismount and travel through the terrain on foot - because it looked on purpose Albrecht looks around to see what looks like the  the same wooden constructs we saw along the aqueduct , upon checking the bandit map we see it is marked as 'the [[Handlers New City]]' - even though it appears to be lightly abandoned - seemingly lining up with when we killed [[Scaletail]] and his crew. 

That night Yuli asks Meara how long they were pretending to be Ari - about 4 months, Yuli asks Ari if she plans on returning home and she says home is a complicated thing and she doesn't know if she wants to return to such a small world - something of a cage - she does however want to go back to see some people but is afraid she wont be able to leave again / will be kept there.
Meara asks Yuli if she plans on returning home to her family - because its only fair after her asking the same. Yuli says she is still figuring out where home is - Ari asks about her dragonborn parents and she says those were the people who raised her and that's where home is but she still doesn't know where she came from and she's still trying to figure that out. Meara dislikes the smell of saltwater in the air - not knowing that the smell is actually the ocean having never seen it before - believing that a lake she saw once to actually be the ocean.

### Arriving to Esa Themar
we break through a treeline to see rolling hills of farmland that leads to a glittering city with a teal basilisk that is set up high on the cliffside, the farmland is populated by people of many races all farming - as we approach the city we see there are some smaller but nice homes under construction - then the smooth sparkling granite walls of the city that are incredibly finely crafted while also being incredibly defensive. We can hear the pounding and crashing of ocean waves in the distance but cannot yet see the ocean as the land slopes uphill to the cliff. 
The families and farms we pass while approaching seem to be the poorest of the people in the area but are still living in a much higer bracket than most. The city as we approach seems to get nicer and nicer and richer as we get closer and closer to town with some of the most expensive houses using the same granite as the walls of the city.
The people are dressed exquisitely and are mostly elven and half elf with a good amount of halflings and one offs of other races.
The shops as we continue through the city are abundant and as we continue we see a sign for the area of the city called [[Raven's Briar]] , the huge basilisk statue, and as we continue we see a sign for [[The Discovery Campus in Esa Themar]].
### The Discovery Campus & Cleabes
We go to the discovery campus and approach a half elf working at the school to ask for directions to [[Benedict Cleabes]] and we are instructed to go to his house near the domed lecture hall - a lone home surrounded by the rest of the city that has refused to sell, the slouching wooden hovel has a small stone path leading through his lush green yard. 

While Thom and Albrecht go to meet Cleabes the rest of the party goes to see the ocean and as we continue through the city we eventually turn a corner to see no buildings at but instead a vineyard of wine grapes with a pathway through the middle that leads - Ari recalls a wine that she saw at [[Tyr Tankard]] called the teal breeze that was very very expensive and upon seeing that the vineyard is so small it clicks that it is very rare. [[The Teal Basilisk]] statue upon closer look is actually a lighthouse - and the teal stone that its made of scatters the sunlight around the buildings.

Upon getting closer to the ocean we see a huge dwarven constructed elevator is seen that can hold at least a hundred people arrive to the top of the cliff. When looking down we can see docks and hundreds of ships - the elevator reminds Yuli of [[Tarum]]. 
We all enter the elevator and Yuli is visibly excited by the sight of the ocean as they have been away from it for the duration of the campaign. 

When we arrive at the bottom we see a rugged older half elf man with longer golden curly hair shouting directions and ordering dockworkers and boats around the yard. We will call him the [[Dockmaster of Esa Themar]] for now.
As we exit the elevator there is a plaque that reads - our greatest engineering feat, paid for the nobility of Esa Themar.

Yuli asks a dockworker if she is allowed to fish and she's told she can fish off the dock around the corner, Yuli goes to the dock and shoots a sheep's head fish with her crossbow and then immediately filets it and offers some to the group. 

After some contemplation while staring at the ocean the group rejoins at Benedict Cleab's House - where Thom and Albrecht have been waiting - after Yuli knocks another ten minutes pass and Cleabes opens the door frazzled saying that the house is in disarray and not fit for guests even after attempting to clean it for hours. He opens his door and waves us in magically opening the gate and as we approach the house the stepping stones that

Thom gives Cleabes a letter that the master of divination and the master of necromancy need to be given the same letter 
the note says that thoms and thoms company can help in any way that Cleabes needs and he requests the the master of necromancy and divination are given information from Thom.
wintercall studying the necromantic properties of winters refuge
master of divination in Zul planned trip to the infected wood in the cleave 
capable of raising the ancient towers but doesn't give the location of them.
Kyris is the master of divination and [[Rine galbolg]]is the master of necromancy 
what is [[The Cleave]]?
- cleabes explaines the cleave is a catastrophic event that struck the beacons /lightingale a couple hundred years ago there was a mass event that he doesn't know all the details of because its generations back, he does know zul and xivine used to be twin cities used to be sister cities right next to one another and at some point the river tears was in between them and the people in each city could no longer talk to one another - when looking to the opposite city they would only see woods on the other side of the river tears. Over the course of the hundreds of years they were eventually able to reconnect vocal communication and within the last 50 years they were able to reconnect the only teleporter between the two cities to cross the cleave and the cleave is a unmapped and unknown formation of land that formed overnight and when people have attempted to explore or cross it they do not return - they have only been able to enter 'infected' areas that have spread in areas around the cleave
- what are the infected woods infected with - there was a group of elves that used to live where the infected woods are and not many of the survived and they fled to create a city called new sathas - the old one (sathas) being 'consumed' by the infected wood. 
- At the discovery school they have developed a way to peer into the cleave but all they have perceived at this point is undecipherable messages but the chatter has become more and more constant and this has led them to believe that there may be something coming - maybe a threat
- He also says he knows we have been combatting the [[The Handler]] - he says the handler is a she and that she is very intelligent with curly red hair she is very strong with light eyes and she's very captivating, she has been very good at bringing people - she is in esa manor and will have a gala soon, and you will need an invitation to get in  it says "you and a guest are invited and it takes place on arvandor 33 (in two days)" Themarin 
- who is V.O.?  Cleabes doesn't know who V.O. is but does know of nobles in the city who may be being blackmailed by the handler for their support. When he says that he seems to be nervous while talking about them being blackmailed, but when asked if he is being blackmailed he says no.
- Do you know a suka orin ? he says yes and to check out [[Honey Hall]] but to be careful because it could be dangerous. 
- On the way out he says to ' follow the path ' and we step on specific stones - as we do we hear chimes or tunes like piano keys.
