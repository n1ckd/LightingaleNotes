## Back to Zul
We choose to head back to [[Zul]] with the corpse of [[Tigerclaw]] & his tiger - as well as the necklace of ears. As we are riding back on horses conjured by Thom, we are attacked in the woods by a large humanoid figure surrounded by eleven others and what looks to be a Firbolg dressed as a druid (13 others). They start attacking us with a crossbow shot and Albrecht takes one hit as we manage to escape - Ari before they are out of range tells them with message "we mean no harm, just passing through , name and affiliation question mark" and they reply "we represent the handler"

We find a well hidden, small, missable area not too far from the lone tree were we cannot be seen except from by the smoke of a fire. We safely pass through the night and then spend the next day getting to Zul, our travel time is slowed by some inclement weather and we arrive at the outer edge of Zul when we see one of the bandits we let go from the handler gang members we ambushed working on a house seemingly living life to the fullest smiling and seems like he is in a much better place. We arrive to the [[Tyr Tankard]] and Ari messages [[Fin]] "We are back and ready to move up the leaderboard meet you out front byeee" we deliver tiger claw and the 10 bandits ears as well as the tiger to Fin and he says that makes us into first place. He says he will weigh the tiger and tell us how he can reward us for it later.

We then go to the merchants guild to collect on the bounty placed on tiger claw. Yuli asks Mars if he had recognized the Firbolg that attacked them and he did not recognize them, upon checking his bestiary under 'Firbolg' he only has a illegible scramble of a page. 
## Prime Shopping District:
### The Pink Elf
A high end inn -  pinkish wood building with a glowing front door, with a prismatic brick color and rainbow windows it feels out of place in the surrounding city- the sign reads [[The Pink Elf]].
In the pink elf Ari Yuli and Thom all attempt to flirt with [[Arelen Runelenrin]] - Yuli manages to talk to them and flirt by getting a kiss on the hand and a wink but still fail pretty hard - not as hard as Thom does though, Thom rolled a natural one and has a nosebleed and passes out.
### Forge of the seas
A sea themed building with classic elven architecture and it has moss on the side of the building with the buildings sides are made of well crafted wood with mist surrounding the building named the [[Forge of the Seas]].
In the Forge there is a older Triton Blacksmith with rough dark blue skin, a little over five foot tall of average build with a round and somewhat attractive face, He has long and very wavy green hair and green eyes. 
On the wall there is a large pike and spear, the quality of his work and his shop is good and meets Clay's Usual Standards. Yuli buys the pike on the wall - it is a long spear like pike with two prongs at the end of it. 
The Forge of the Seas are one of the oldest blacksmiths in the city and run by [[Vunrus Valesnath]].
### Goods of the Tribe
We also see a shop crafted with wood and materials similar to the older buildings in Zul, the sign that reads [[Goods of the Tribe]]. 
As well as a small round building with the occasional puff of green smoke coming out of it -although there is no chimney -named [[Lith's Little Chemist]].

### Hunkering down for the night
We return to [[Tyr Tankard]] and stay the night in our in our own rooms and we plan to spend some more time in Zul as we have about 22 days left to compete in the monster hunting competition and we want to spend some of the gold we have earned and do some investigating into the town of Zul and perhaps [[The Elven Council]].
