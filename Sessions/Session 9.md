### After the Aqueduct
Mars goes and cures Ari's wound's then the party beings looking around the Aqueduct. We loot the bodies of the captains, and find nothing of note other than their scimitars and daggers - the only real thing of value on them is 10 GP between the corpses. Yuli finds 40 GP on the corpses on the other side of the river. Mars removes the ears of the bandits in the area - adding 20 more ears to the necklace. Clay and mars investigate the aqueduct itself and we see the water in the image is flowing from left to right, there are grates with some algae and there is a good amount of water flowing - a signifigant amount. 
On the observation deck we find a [[Ancient stone urn]] that is sealed closed and has some ancient writing on it, 
a small pouch with a symbol of a crocodile head with a shield on it that has a scaled texture - inside which is 5 blue quartz stones worth 10gp each, 
in the grass around the observation deck we find 6 moss agot which is worth 10gp each again, 
at the bottom of the pouch there is another gaming dice set as well. 
we find another bandit map with notes on it labelled "city plans"
we find another [[Handler Support Letter]]
at the bottom of the well we see a bunch of bodies and common weapons (handaxe, longbow, etc) the people at the bottom of the well seem to be other bandits?  with detect magic at the bottom of the well we find 2 oils of etherealness- allowing the user to essentially become, and we find a spell scroll tucked into the slit of the observation deck - a fabricate spell scroll.
The structures were made using the fabricate spell instead of being handmade - built rushed with magic
the water is flowing from west to east - away from the coast and uphill the water is coming from lower ground it seems to be coming  from [[Coastal Revine]] and goes into the [[Themar Wilds]] after tasting the water it seems to be freshwater but it comes from the coastal revine which is a saltwater tide-pool like area.

### Following the aqueduct
we decide to follow the aqueduct to the west - we decide to walk atop the aqueduct to have an advantage and see wherever we are going ahed of time. we follow it towards the source of the water at the coast towards [[Coastal Revine]]. The aqueduct is only big enough to walk single file and it weaves through the treetops being relatively covered from view while still being a big metal structure. The water has a significant flow the whole way through.
The aqueduct seems to ramp up to what appears to be a giant tower with nothing too significant at the top - we decide instead of trying to walk up the steep ramp to climb down and follow the supports until we get to the base of the tower.
The water is incredibly loud and being forcefully pushed up through a huge pipe.
looking past to the coastal ravine we can see the ocean - mars was here within the last year and none of this was here. looking into the tidal pool we dont see any kind of mechanism or building we do notice that there is a deeper end to the tide pool.
Under a pile of brush near the base of the tower we find a locked trapdoor. Yuli picks the lock and we see a steep staircase that has torches lining the walls.
### Into the Passage
The passage seems to be a carved stone tunnel, we set a alarm at the entrance and use a mage hand to disguise the entrance behind us, we descend eighty feet down the staircase and begin to hear the sound of dripping water when the staircase ends and we find ourselves looking down a double wide doorway where the hallway fans out then comes to a double wide arch.
Mars notices 3 tripwires in the hallway as Albrecht and Clay trigger the first one and take four piercing damage each the group manages to get through the rest of the wires unharmed. 

The next room we enter is visibly more wet than the last one as there is water dripping down some of the walls and the floor is damp. We can hear what sounds like running water. It is further down the path we are heading down - we turn a right corner to a narrow hall and a bright light we hear a consistant thwipping noise like a bow string - we conjure the hounds and send one forward, where we see it step on a stone and turn a corner - we hear it die from a trap then a group of bandits come investigate sending one of them back towards the entrance behind us. Ari and thom manage to decive the fuck out of the poor bandit messaging him convincing him they are rytus and they challenge him to traverse the hallway with his eyes closed for a reward. We tell him that his reward will be under his pillow that night and he returns to the group.
we wait some time before procceeding and then sneak forward to find a large cave with a underground river and a encampment of tents across the river, we notice two small tents to the left with resting bandits within them with two sleeping and two at the campfire - as the two archers turn to see us and then shout " hey boss I think I know why tigerclaw stopped replying " and a huge captain across the river appears out of a tent we see who we can assume is [[Scaletail]].
