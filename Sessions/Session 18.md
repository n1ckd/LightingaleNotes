## Session Notes
### Beginning of Notes
We begin the session by following the bloody tracks from last session, about a day away from the manor a dead body in the road ahead - the body of a server in the manor. It looks like he bled out from slash wounds on the body - wounds that were not super deep but were seemingly made from a blade and were enough for him to have bled out. They have likely died in the last four hours. We find on them what we would expect but they had very little apart from pieces of paper notes etc. We see another set of footprints with significantly less blood continuing onward - ones we think do not belong to an attacker but someone who was traveling with them. As we are investigating we hear rustling in the bushes nearby / and we see the familiar uniform of a servant dart away. We convince them to stop running and come across a young elvish woman - the daughter of the dead servant in the road. She is not talking but we use detect thoughts to be able to communicate. 

She escaped the battle and her mother defended her as she fled. we ask her what she wants to be done with the corpse - we decide to bury her nearby and offer to take the young girl with us. [[Ending]] is her name - she cannot talk but can use sign language. Her name was given to her by [[The Handler]] she is given the name [[Vanya]] by Yuli. We give her a dagger and some rations to eat, which she devours - and we bring her along with us. While traveling we learn that her muteness is likely a curse - as it doesn't show up with detect magic but she says its magical. 

While we travel the next day we run into to some pretty serious downpour - with Thom conjuring a unseen servant to serve as a umbrella, clay has his poncho up and Meara tries to shield themselves with a mage hand to no effect - getting soaked. 
The rest of the party seems comfortable getting wet.

After we get to [[Benedict Cleabes]] we give him the shifting specimens we found in [[Esa Manor]] dark black cloudy
ethereal liquid
black swirling mixture of ethereal and black liquid. 

After Mars gives [[Benedict Cleabes]] the unstable potions of were we found in the manor, he says they are distilled essence and that is pretty dangerous so he stores them.

The master of necromancy has run into issues at [[Winters Refuge]] and may need help sooner rather than later - there have been issues with his research so [[Benedict Cleabes]] suggests we visit him.
