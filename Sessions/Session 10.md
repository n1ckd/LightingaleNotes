## Session Notes
### Fighting Scaletail
[[Scaletail]] starts the fight by glowing green under the scales of his body, the green hue grows brighter and he smiles - regenerating health. He then yells "GET EM GIRL!" and a crocodile burrows out of the ground ontop of clay. We manage to defeat both Scaletail, his crocodile and the bandit captains. After defeating Scaletail his scales stop glowing.
### Looting after the fight 
Albrecht hears a mechanical churning to the east where the water is flowing to. Thom skins the crocodile. Yuli finds the map with hand drawn markings on it, and his gear has the same symbol we found on the dice bag. 
Clay gives Mars a healers kit from clay that he finds on the table.
Ari uses comprehend languages to talk to [[Caged Duergars]] that we found in the cavern and they seem to truthfully say that they have been captured for months and have been being used to build the aqueduct . 
Ari gets a bag of 20 caltrops and 50 feet of rope. 
Yuli finds a [[leger of shipments]] and 80gp, a sheet with a [[key contact for the handler]] and a [[map of the entire east beacon]] 
Mars investigates the crystals in the area and they seem to be natural formations form the salt water in the cavern.
Yuli finds a [[Voltemand Wanted Poster]] for a person belonging to the [[Voltemand Family]] in the bandit tents, basic fishing equipment, 1000cp and 1800sp, and a bottle of holy water

As the duergar round the corner to see mars they become panicked and in undercommon say "the talking grove i've seen him before at the talking grove" Ari tries to have clay talk to them and as she mentions the [[Talking Grove]].

mars goes over and plucks a crystal out of the pile he investigated before believing it to be his lucky crystal - he then attaches it to his necklace of ears. 

when asking the [[Caged Duergars]] when they saw mars at the grove they say they saw mars years ago at the talking grove - they say they saw him or someone who looked a lot like him at the grove years ago. After clay has convinced them that mars is not a threat they seem ok with him and mars does not recognize it.

a finely crafted short sword 
2 bottles of alchemist fire
800sp
an unformed signet ring
10ft of finely crafted chain

### During the night watch
 Ari burns the wanted poster in plain sight of Albrecht and says that she ran into her possibly in disguise, Ari says that they had good reason to be hiding from the family, Ari wants them to be hopefully safe. 
 Albrecht asks Ari what the prisoners were saying- Ari says that they may know more about Mars's past and that the Firbolg working with the handler may know more? Ari says mars seemed not to recognize them and Albrecht said that he didn't seem to recognize much of anything except that crystal. They talk about mars possibly being aligned with the handler and his crew, but don't think that mars would have been that person or at least he would be trying to turn over a new leaf.
 Mars then wakes up to a crystal around his neck he has no memory of collecting.
