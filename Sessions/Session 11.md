## Session Notes
### Beginning of Notes
We part ways with the [[caged duergars]] as they go west after leaving Scaletail's lair, as the group rides back to [[Zul]] mars realizes the salt crystal is around his neck and decides to drop it - when the rest of the party sees this they question him about it and while he doesnt remember anything about the crystal they drop it relatively fast but mars keeps the crystal in his bag to keep for later. 

Upon settling for a campsite we see two Pegasus fly away through the tree tops - likely because we spooked them coming through the underbrush.

### Back in Zul

We roll and seem to regain time on our approach to [[Zul]] we see one of our captures friends that we set free - now a foreman working on the construction outside of Zul. Albrecht asks the half elf why there has been so much construction and expansion as of late. The answer is that there are a lot of refugees coming to Zul. Albrecht pushes and asks about the construction by the handler - he says the handler had a lot of support to build a new city in the wilds, it was supposed to help the nobility in [[Esa Themar]] gain more power.

We bring our bounty back to [[Fin]] and he asks if we have seen a group of druids, they are another adventuring party of half elves who seem to have gone missing and no one has seen them since the 13th of Arvandor.

We then go back to the [[Merchants Guild]] to claim the bounty on [[Scaletail]], [[Odidove Goodbrand]] gives us each 100gp for the head and on our way back to [[Tyr Tankard]] we check the contract board near the main tower of zul - it is covered in contracts for construction and looking for home building workers. 
There is a delivery request from a noble to go to [[gold maldyr]].
Ari finds another [[Voltemand Wanted Poster]]
A half ripped piece of paper that says [[Mission to the Forgotten Lodge poster]], on a history check we know that the [[Forgotten Lodge]] refers to the original founding place of Zul where the elven tribes met and no one knows where it is today. 

Later in the rooms ari burns the [[Voltemand Wanted Poster]] and as she burns it she feels a hand on her shoulder then hears ' it might be time but ill let you decide ' - and the wanted poster burns
### Shopping in Zul
Fin lets us know that there is a [[Discovery School of Magic]] store that is run by students and might be the magic shop that Ari is remembering. We are trying to find some enchanted items - so we head to the part of Zul that the school is in and we see a crazy amount of building with the crest of the school, in fact there are probably so many houses being built outside Zul because the school takes up so much space. 

We find the [[Discovery Magic Shop]] with a sign in the window that says 'run by our own'. Once we enter a female human student apparates at the counter and asks us if we need anything from them. We ask the [[Magic Student]] if she could enchant Albrecht's bow and she says it would cost 700gp but she could do it - as that is a lot of money we elect to come back when we have more. Thom buys a scroll of shield for 90gp. The cost for enchanted weapons is 750gp (-50 if you bring the weapon).
We then go to the [[Forge of the Seas]] to see [[Vunrus Valesnath]] to see what they have while there mars buys scale mail armor for 50gp and gives yuli his studded leather armor - we then head to [[Goods of the Tribe]] to see if we can pick up some potions. We talk to [[Arlayna Torfir]] who is excited to see us - we buy a crate of 6 health potions from her at a discount and mars sells a used scimitar to her for 15gp.

Thom and Yuli then break off to go to [[The Pink Elf]] to see [[Arelen Runelenrin]] and they compete for her favor they ask her what her favorite drink is - which is a dry martini - both of them order one and Arelen asks them who can finish it first - they then both roll nat 20s

Ari asks mars if he has anything about fog in his book and upon checking he has a page on purple fog in the underdark. But mars brings up the [[Nightmare Fog]] that they experienced during [[Session 0.5]] and it turns out Ari also experienced it but instead of being set back over a day of travel she was progressed a day. All members were knocked out and had nightmares that seemed to be of their past - what could have been the worse thing to happen to them but twisted. Albrecht seemed extra bothered by it but it is a similar reaction to last time.

Thom hears a message in their head "thomasson this is benedict cleabes i'm [[Esa Themar]] word of your work has made your way to my ear - please make your way to my place of living
