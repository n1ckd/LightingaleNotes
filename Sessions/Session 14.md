## Session Notes
### The night before the Gala
 The first hour of [[Albrecht]] and [[Meara Voltemand]]'s watch is quiet and it seems albrecht is holding back questions for Meara, when asked albrecht clarifies that he just wanted to reassure meara that he has no intentions of letting her be forced back home and that he would stick up for her if needed. 
 Meara asks if Albrecht is a parent because they have had such good paternal instincts and is very protective of [[Yuli]] - Albrecht clarifies that they are not in fact a parent and that they actually work for Yuli as a bodyguard. 
 Albrecht also explains that they used to be a mercenary and regrets it -something Meara can relate to as they were trained for something they no longer want to do as well. 
 Meara asks Albrecht how they differentiate what is reality and what they think is reality - Albrecht is unsure but offers to help in any way they can -but Meara says its something that they have left at home and hope it stays there. 
#### Mars and Yuli
mars asks yuli about [[Cliffton DeBolbec]] and his plant but she doesnt really know much about the 
mars opens his book and flips to a page called mars - he is familar to with the page 
after drifting off to look at the manor mars sees a man clamber out of the basement double doors 

#### Clay
after mars reported the wereboar incident clay watched the guards and he infferred that there are only two sets of guards a morning shift and night shift 

#### The next morning
We confer the next morning to talk about the wereboar prisoner escape attempt -  and Yuli identifies that its not arcana or studied magic, Albrecht on hearing this stars mumbling something that seems like a prayer and recedes from the conversation - Yuli notices and asks what they said but albrecht says that it was nothing and then directs his attention to the manor - 
we observe two guards in the tower, double guard at the front door, and the occasional roaming guard on the upper level of the main hall. 
We also see as the sun is rising the manor in full detail - it has a beautiful handmade cobblestone base with a large watchtower on the right a middle tower that comes out on the main ballroom area, the roof is a brown darkish tile and the walls are mainly white but with splashes of tan and cream, there is also wood siding that lines the outside of the manor that cuts it into squares and rectangles. 

The group decides to send Meara and Yuli into the party under disguises Firrah and Enna graythorn- with Yuli using Meara's disguise ring and Meara going as herself with a disguise self spell active as sun elves who were travelling merchants using the corvid sigil as a logo. They coin flip for who is the older sister and Yuli wins. Thom summons a raven familar to go in with them and communicate with Mars and Clay through Thom's body so if they need to make a quick exit mars and clay can help. 
The trail leading to the manor weaves around the garden on the side of the manor that doesn't have a exterior wall where the line to enter is attended to by a singular red dragonborn guard. The line is mostly elves and half elves dressed to the nines - there dresses, tailored suits, shoulder capes, nice boots and bags, fine hats, etc. After waiting for ten to fifteen minutes the line begins to move forward. The sun begins to set and the bright orange of the sky reflects off of the manor making it appear orange instead of white. Upon reaching the manor the dragonborn guard asks for their invitation then welcomes them in - when passing Yuli says in dragonborn "thank you" to the guard and he smiles and says a read noble. Inside what we previously assumed to be two stories is actually one huge ballroom with pillars lining each side and a balcony on the other end that overlooks the ocean. There is a banquet of food on both ends of the hall with nobles and well dressed citizens around them , the hall also has statues that were added to it after of what we think to be a female pantheon god in different poses. Meara doesn't recognize anyone, Thom recognizes people wearing the crest of the discovery school of magic, Yuli spots [[The Handler]] and lets Meara and crow Thom know. Yuli while uncomfortable is able to act the part - while looking around the room 
[[erodh cromville]] is an older elven man who sees them getting drinks and warns them that they catch up to you fast - while throwing a flute back himself. He says the cromville family has a lot of real estate in [[Esa Themar]] operating through [[Raven's Briar]]. He says he is a founding supporter of the handler and that he will be one of a few going to the next tier of the event - something private only for the founding members. There will also be a vote for the future of [[Themarin]]. Mars and Clay stealth forward with Thoms body to keep in range of the familar. The girls inside listen in to the Drow who we previously met and they seem to be talking to guests very excited for the event and the 

the handler has a paleish skintone with bright red hair that is wavy and drops to their mid chest. its unclear what race they are off first impression as their ears are hidden in their hair - they are humanoid. Meara tries to see if any of the servers are able to talk but they are all silent and preoccupied. after messaging one of them she sends a few messages back and forth: 
are you 
trans - transformation... [[vesh]]
are the guests in danger too we will try to help ?
not sure .. kept in cages
who were you before transformation ?
merchant guild

the handler is involved with a death diety merchants guild employees kept in cages downstairs and used for stairs 

The girls try to identify someone who maybe isnt as happy to be here and find [[jett]] they approach them and find out they are newer only joining a few months ago, after meeting VO (the drow) their family used to run a business through the east and west beacon through the oceans and that is no longer possible because of [[The Cleve]] they shipped goods between [[Esa Themar]] and [[Wardens Harbor]]. They say that the handler has plans for [[The Cleve]] but they don't know the specifics as they havent donated enough- but VO could tell you more.
The handler's face is sharp in almost every way a face could be sharp - shes dressed in a white dress that flows over her like the statues lining the hall and her red curls fall down her shoulders. For some reason this manner looks so natural for her, she then reaches out to shakes Meara's hand and two things are noticeable her hands are very soft and her skin is thinner and slightly cold. While her body is thinner she exudes a radiance of control. She thanks Meara for her patronage and continues greeting guests. she has icy white eyes.
For her speech she thanks the patrons and says they have all backed their beautiful city of [[Themarin]] she asks for a show of support then everyone raises a glass - everyone raises a glass and then the servants begin going around collecting tithes from the guests. They then call for the founding members and donators to join them for a vote and to hear about the future of [[Themarin]].
I will see all of you soon in the new world - and the servers that have been around start herding people out.
Meara shoots a messsage through the floor randomly and asks
they are coming we are here to help how many are you? 
a loud crackling voice in your head says we'll be ready. 

Meara asks the same servant as before
