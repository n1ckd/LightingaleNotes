We start the monster hunt, fend off a group of bears, and sleep in a tree.

## Session Notes
### The morning after meeting
The party slept the night in Tyr Tankard, having all been introduced and grouped together under the goal of competing in the monster slaying competition run by the Taverns owner. Tom Albrecht and Mars share some tea and Clay buys some street food off a vendor outside.
The monster hunting competition is an open competition where you can go after whatever you want in the Themar wilds - it must be beast or beast like in nature like a monster or a monstrosity.
Everything in the forest that is beast like or beast it would be considered unaligned or evil - with some Fae and a few fiend creatures also exist in the wilds.

### Starting the hunt
Yuli would sneer at Tom at them mention of hunting dragons - Tom insight checked the sneer and realized something about the comment hit home. We travel out for about a day to hit the beginning of the Themar forest tree line and can expect to hit the forest the next day. We camp out for the night under a large tree. After making dinner we begin to be approached by eight figures in coming from the tall grass.
### Combat Encounter
We defeated / fended off eight bears with only one escaping. 
### Sleeping Order
We establish the watch order with Ari & Mars on first watch, Yuli will have finished their trance and watch for shifts two and three- joining Yuli on shift 2 is Albrecht, on shift 3 Clay will join Yuli to round out the night with Thom as another option.
