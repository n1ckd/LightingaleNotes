## Session Notes
The party wakes up after staying at [[Tyr Tankard]] with the intention of following up on the [[Merchants Guild]] in [[Zul]]. Yuli wakes up first with Albrecht and Thom following shortly after. Yuli does a backflip after getting drunk at 7:30 in the morning then Thom has them do a field sobriety test in the tavern and they fail pretty bad. Yuli says they work in a pub all day so they are used to being some extent of drunk during the day.  Clay finds some amazing breakfast tacos and Mars is the last to wake up. The group decides to split up with Ari & Yuli going to the fish market and Albrecht, Mars, Clay, and Thom going to follow up on the id with the merchants guild. The group goes through the grove gate section of the city and we see the building architecture begin to change to elven architecture with long buildings and many windows - known as the beacon bureau then reach a crossroads with paths leading to the spire, the merchants guild in the prime shoppe area, and the fish market near the poorer section of the city. 
#### The merchants guild 
Mars Clay & Thom and Albrecht take a right at the crossroad to go the merchants guild, inside we are met with a single representative at a desk - a stout female halfling is attending [[Odidove Goodbrand]] they identified the card as belonging to "[[Sirin]]" saying that they have been missing for some time (about 2 weeks) and were assumed to have been claimed by [[Handler Gang]] and gives us a flyer to neutralize them (dead or alive) Odi suggests that "Sirin" and his crew were trying to get back their precious cargo from the bandits in the area.
#### The Fish Market
Yuli and Ari meet a older golden female dragonborn who offers to sell them fish on ice. The dragonborn asks why Yuli is able to speak dragonborn and they realize that they know Yuli's dad [[Drilkesh Iriekria]] and then gives Yuli her order of fish in a magic bag. Yuli also asks the dragonborn about [[Suka Orin]] finding out that they are in the west beacon. 

### Meeting at the Tavern & Planning 
The group reconnects at Tyr Tavern where we eat some sushi and decide to head out to seek out the bandits - during the first day of travel Yuli asks Thom to identify the bag they received from the dragonborn. Its a bag of holding but refrigerated. 
#### The First Night
We stay our night under the ### Tracking 
the next day we identify tiger tracks, sliding tracks with insect like markings, and displacer beast tracks. 
the tiger tracks go south east, the thin sliding tracks lead east and the displacer beast tracks also go eastward.
we choose to follow the tiger tracks but assume that the paths we have been seeing belong to the bandits as they have been travelling through the woods.
We end the day by setting camp up off the road behind rocks - here Ari finds in a chunk of rock the icon of [[Rytus]] 
All 5 armed people going through the woods with crossbows and swords heading from south to north. We assume this group is the bandits in the area and decide to follow them. we successfully sneak up to them and when they hit a clearing they spread out into a semi circle we surprise attack them killing two of the five immediately then tying up the reaming three and interrogating them for information about the [[Handler Gang]] in the area. We get a map of the [[Themar Wilds Map]]
and have the bandits identify where the wanted members are. The bandits each have 
a schimitar
a crossbow
20 bolts
1 gold 2 silver 18 copper
we tie up and convince the three bandits to turn their lives around and build houses in zul. One bandit is grungy and depressed but ari coinflips their future and they agree to build houses. 
#### Tigerclaw hunt
The group tracks the tiger that they assume belongs to [[Tigerclaw]] and at a half mile to the south east of us we use pass without a trace to sneak up on the ping of the tiger. We sneak up and see a column of white marble that we assume to be [[The Ruined Temple]] and get ready to fight the bandits inside. We have seen around ten bandits with more unseen including tigerclaw and his tiger.
