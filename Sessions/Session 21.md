## Session Notes
### Beginning of Notes
We start the session at [[Grasping Vines]] leaving [[Vanya]] behind as we recap on what we are trying to do we are going to answer the call of [[Rine galbolg]] and visit [[Winters Refuge]] & [[Wintercall]] to learn about [[Necro-shifting]]. [[Necro-shifting]] is something Thom has heard about briefly in [[Discovery School of Magic]] but was not sure if it was real and was only confirmed recently by [[Benedict Cleabes]] and our experiences with the [[Handler Gang]].

We reach and area that we havent been to before, an area considered to be the poorest in [[Esa Themar]] called [[The Mist Wall]] it is still nicer than any shanty town we have seen anywhere else. It is covered in a layer of mist that leaves a layer of salt that dries on the streets from the sea fog - we see people coming out of their homes to scrape it off of the floors and walls. 
As we continue we come to the cliffs on the edge of Themar, it is known for its views where you can see the peaks of the [[Richland Mountain Range]] and on the other side the gulf of the ocean down the cliff
### Riding to Winters Refuge
[[Yuli]] got mad at her father [[Drilkesh Iriekria]] for trying to keep her safe and protected from the world, and leaving behind [[Vanya]] has made her realize & understand that side of that relationship - and that she may not be as prepared to go on this voyage as she thought. She feels homesick and she is not used to asking for help she wants to make her mother proud and prove her father right. [[Albrecht]] points out that [[Yuli]] has been asking for help for a long time, and doesn't want her to feel bad about it.
[[Meara Voltemand]] sympathizes because she has had to leave her family behind and leaving [[Vanya]] behind is also bringing those feelings to the surface. Trusting [[Cliffton DeBolbec]] with [[Vanya]] is all you can do right now.

### Nightmare Fog

We encountered [[Nightmare Fog]] at different times [[Meara Voltemand]] fell asleep and was moved two days further into their journey while [[Mars]] [[Yuli]] and [[Albrecht]] were moved back a day and a half , all members fell asleep and experienced some of their worst memories again.

### The first night
In our dreams we see a burst of light, a shimmering hand reach out of the light, a third person perspective shows us how small we are in comparison to the hand - then a light descends from it and a small star is given to us - giving us a luck point. 

[[Meara Voltemand]] and [[Yuli]] talk about their relationships [[Vanya]] and want to talk about their feelings towards protecting them - Meara felt the need to protect [[Vanya]] because her sister / the real Ari ([[Enari Voltemand]]), is mute and she had to leave all of her siblings behind so she felt the need to look after not only 3 siblings but now 4. Yuli says that she felt like she was only a band-aid for the people freed from keenton, and wants to do more now that she is on her own. 

Meara says she cracked under the pressure of the standards of her family and her culture, and while safety or protection of those walls is good its was keeping her inside of a pressure chamber. She decided to leave home and has been dealing with the feelings and emotions of leaving and seeing [[Vanya]] has brought many of those emotions crashing again. She talks about her sister [[Enari Voltemand]] as she was the sibling she was closest to, she is the most creative and her other sister [[Tilden Voltemand]], as well as [[Amar Voltemand]] who she doesn't get along with super well but will likely take up after her father.

### The next day
We continue to follow the coast and come across the familar sight of the trees in the themar wilds, the woods seem a little different as we get further from the familar - the trees become less uniform in the sense that they are more gnarled or unique - the forest seems to rise and fall with noise as we travel through. The path is unchanged from anywhere that we have previously been its a trade and travel trail that is used often. The forest seems to respond to the groups movements ebbing and flowing with us and we make up 2 days travel time. Moving between the two areas it seems very natural for this to happen.

### Mars dream / middle of the night

Mars dreams that he is a deep dark section of forest and he is able to move freely he sees the path infront of him that goes deeper into the forest and behind him he sees the faint glow of a campfire

as he proceeds into the forest he hears familar noises and feels cloudy feelings of rememberance as he pushes forward and the rise and fall of the forest sounds become a constant stream of whispers, all at once they continue incoherent but loud - at a certain point they rise until reaching a fever pitch
mars falls to his knees and clutches his ears the noise becomes unbearable and the whispers are left behind as the ground opens up beneath him and he falls past the same fungal growth into the same pool of liquid then wakes up in the dark in the woods near the campsite he now has fungal growths ringing his wrists.

He comes back to [[Yuli]] and [[Meara Voltemand]] and sorts through clays belongings looking for a flask or any kind of alcohol - I then ask Yuli for alchol and she gives me a shot of rum which gives me one point of drunkenness.

if i get to 8 ill be drunk, ill have a -2 to int and wis checks and all saving throws and ill suffer a -2 to weapon and spell attacks

if i get to 13 ill be wasted ill make a con save once every hour while awake ill vomit for a minute taking my actions , if im wasted when going to sleep i have to make a con save 

if i get to 16 i am incapacitated 

### the next day
on our travels the next day the woods open up a bit more and we come across a [[hooded vampire figure]] they are a half elf wearing the garb of a [[Kundek]] follower - a messenger or a scout for the vampire group, they say a phrase to identify themselves "praise be to the most powerful" and Albrecht knows what they are saying but chooses to be more subtle and while they pass by we hear them say "strange for a vonstruben to be so far north" they continue to walk away leaving us alone. 

We continue forward as the environment becomes less forest and more snow covered, with the smell of fresh water coming from a nearby river leading to the coast and the scent of smoke coming from nearby houses trying to stay warm. The city is split in two on either side of the river with bridges spanning it through the center of the city. The edges of the river are freezing but there is still flowing water as it enters the walls of the city. As we approach the city we see little stands of merchants that are trying to profit off of travelers entering and leaving the city.

large goliath stand guard at the gates of [[Wintercall]], as we enter the city we pass by rows of warehouses called the stockades that are full of supplies for the winter - the city is made primarily of goliath and half elves but has a variety of one off races. 

Howling bridges is the area in the center of [[Wintercall]] where the wind whistles through the bridges, with a 5story tall building on the northmost end of the bridges with whistling rest
the innkeeper is a younger wood elf with short waivy black hair and black eyes, they are 4'11 [[Xeno thejor]] they tell us [[Rine galbolg]] if you follow the river it will lead to a waterfall and the path up the mountain.
There are large boulders that dot the path outside of the city as if they came down from the mountain, we follow the icy river and about an hour into the walk we feel the 

small humanoid footprint about 20ft ahed of us in the snow that have made a muddy or soggy look along the trail - and about 500 meters away is a small log cabin with a plume of smoke coming out of the top - but we then hear a scream to the left , then we follow the scream to find [[Rine galbolg]] on a giant stone being attacked by a frost troll leading 5 small guard drakes on a leash. 

the stone is smooth but unnatural - not manmade but still out of place, the stone has tiny glyphs around the base of the stone. the glyphs are of a divination magic, they are ancient runes of [[Rytus]] tied to his temples and artifacts - this is a large piece of something but the runes are inactive and the stone seems to go deeper underground, on asking [[Rine galbolg]] if they know anything about them and they don't, we decide to help them explore the caves that seem to be the origin of the aura of magic and the subject of the research being done by Rine. There was a previous group of assistants sent to help Rine but a few days ago they disappeared into the same caves.

### Back to the Cabin
After we agree to help her explore the caves, we begin following her back to the cabin & her research, we check back through the woods towards the cabin and step inside to a single large room with a bed , a research table, some supplies and 

she has been here for 3 weeks, and a few days ago 3 hired solider types two elves and a goliath went into the caves and haven't been seen since - the main goal of the research has been to understand the magical prosperities of the mountain as they have been recently giving off a magical aura of divination that was normal but has changed to an aura of necromancy. They sent them into the caves in an attempt to explore he tunnels before they froze over from winter.

the [[Necro-shifting]] technique is still early in development that is a veil of sorts used to shroud yourself but so far it has been too weak for [[The Cleave]] or the trial area in [[The Infected Woods]]. The spell was developed by the schools through a combination of efforts from [[Benedict Cleabes]] and master wizards from [[Pleasant Hill Arcana]].  The area is pretty inhabitable and harsh especially in winter, cave collapses and freezing over is pretty common and while some animals have been seen there have not been corpses found of them. The previous group was more likely to have died to a monster or animal than too a hazard, The cave formed recently around when the aura of the mountain shifted.

### Journey to Taylor's wet chilled caveussy
we leave the cabin and on our trip to the cave we are greeted with some beautiful natural landscapes that have some frozen lakes and rivers with some gentle terrain that as we approach the mountain becomes very rapidly inclined, the cave mouth is seen another 20 to 30 feet - the entrance to the cave is elevated above the ground and the section of the mountain near the cave is very jagged and broken stone. The cave is very solid and white - it looks like it has been shredded with deep gashes through the walls, it looks like the caves thom saw in their vision when breaking [[Vanya]]'s curse with [[Benedict Cleabes]] the vision where we saw [[The Oracle]]. The jagged markings are not natural but we are not sure what they are from.
The cave is like 20-30 feet and begins to narrow and after it gets to a certain point the tunnels begin to switch back on top of themselves deeper and deeper into the mountain - the only sounds we hear water dripping (getting louder as we go down) - in many of the bigger rooms we see large chunks of rocks that seem to have fallen while the creature tunneled through the environment. Thom decides to scout ahead by conjuring a bat and sees in the caves ahed various temples or ruins exist because of how often the land shifts and it is plausible that many of the old original temples have been lost or sunk into the environment. We drop down into the cave to take a closer look at the ruins the rooms we see would have been outer walls to the temple, with collapsed or half walls built of the same stone we saw from the [[The Ruined Temple]] and we can guess its another temple to [[Rytus]].
Parts of the ceiling have melted away and fell and we notice that it has started to get warmer as we have gotten deeper - the roof in the room we are in doesn't look like it fell apart from structural issues but it looks like it got warmer and part of it fell. 
The room we enter has 2 statues of [[Rytus]] that are ancient with a new fiend statue replacing a shattered statue of rytus in the middle of the 2 other statues. The statues of Rytus are much older than the fiend statue and we can tell that it was teleported in the place of the ruined statue - we investigate the ruined statue but all we find is a tablet with the same magical glyphs we found on the stone from last session. the fiend statue has a glowing magical aura that hints at transmutation 
We push past the statues into the next room and are met with a dead end that falls out from under us as we fall into an arena

There are 4 pedestals in the room with glowing red energies above them, and in the far end of the room the beautiful white haired woman is posed channeling some kind of energy or raising her hands - she has a red glowing aura coming from behind her head. This room is defiantly the warmest with the most amount melted water. The melted water in the room is sucked into the oracle and dissapates into vapor when they cast a spell.
