## Session Notes
### Lith's & Goods of the Tribe.
We return to the Prime Shoppes to then go to the [[Lith's Little Chemist]] where Thom sells a blue green gemstone, Ari sells some azurite, and Yuli sells 4 rose quartz for 250gp. Thom also asks if they offer services to copy the spell scrolls we got from the tiger claw fight, they would cost 50gp each and will take 2 hrs to get them transcribed into Thom's spell book.
We then go into the next shop to meet [[Arlayna Torfir]] a very young female half elf 5'6 lean copper skin oval face with fingers that are slightly webbed is the shopkeeper of the [[Goods of the Tribe]]. We learn about [[Talking Grove]] and that it contains [[Torfir Lillies]] that the shopkeeper wants and will give us a discount if can bring them. The [[Torfir Tribe]] and its control of [[The Elven Council]].
Thom buys a health potion after Ari lends them 20 gp to buy it for 50 gp total.
The group returns to [[Tyr Tankard]] and mars has [[dream_1]] that night
### The next day
The group notices Mars sleeping in and his mushrooms are larger and one is growing back on his shoulder. After talking with mars and realizing that he doesn't really know where he got them from in the first place. We decide to go after [[GhoulStinger]] in the [[Coastal Revine]] because we known that that is most likely to net us a encounter instead of scouring the woodlands for [[Scaletail]]. When we get to the lone tree outside of [[Zul]] we hear a mix of common and some grunts that sound like the boar we fought in the woods previously. We see some bipedal forms that are shifting in between boar and man a camp of about nine [[Wereboar]] that we think are hostile so we decide to leave and setup camp in a grass covered space below a hill. From our camp we can see the smoke from their fire, and by the end of Mars's watch the smoke seems to be dying down -  during Clay's watch we see a humanoid form of a wereboar that is keeping watch near that camp in a tree where they take shifts for the night. We manage to avoid them. 
### We take a detour 
On what we assume is a bandit path we find a [[Magical Elven Arch]] in the woods that has some elven runes inscribed on it, after walking through it we seem to see better, allowing us to have advantage on perception checks and overall have a good feeling. When mars casts detect magic he sees the runes glow on the arch as well as the magical items / auras on his party members - something he hasn't noticed in the past was Ari's magical aura on her hands - maybe her rings?
### The Aqueduct
We arrive to the aqueduct and hear the sound of running water, some chatter and the sound of metal in the background. When we run into members of the handler gang.
