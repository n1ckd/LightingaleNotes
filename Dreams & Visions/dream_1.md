after [[Session 8]] mars goes to sleep in [[Tyr Tankard]] and mars is troubled going to sleep he sees flashes in his dreams
puffs of darkness and glowing mars pushes through after a charsima saving throw and he travels through well lit forest paths where trees move with me and embrace me
green smoke
puffing silver
i see something in the distance a large form the shape is convuluted and massive and i cant make it out but it terrifys me and makes mars afraid a fear he has never felt as mars
the trees bend down towards me and whisper to me things i cant understand
i wake up with sweat dripping down me and i cant move but im terrified im sleeping on my side facing into the room and im stuck like this without being able to see anything in the room I hear nothing and can do nothing for an hour and ten minutes before my head is able to move and over the next few minutes i can move again and go down to the bathroom where i cut off a mushroom that are now larger 
the mushroom is dark green with veins of light green running through it. 
the talking grove was mentioned that day and the grove was talking to me in the dream
