- Is the Symphony tied to the Concert? 
	-  Apart from the musical naming convention The west beacon is much more of a knowledge seeking / anti establishment type of group versus the stricter east beacon and the elven council that runs it. And from what we know about the deity Vakaris & the note in the bandit camp advertising "the cleave"
	- The Concert may be the west beacon's counterpart to The Elven Council? Taylor lists them as the two biggest factions in the world
	- Why is the Concert / The Symphony hiring for the handler gang & what are they trying to change to bring about the 'new world'
- The Handler Gang and its Supporters / "V.O." 
	- who or what is V.O "your supporters and I" seems to point to it being a individual, they are funding / backing the handler & his plan to take the future into their own hands because of the stagnant and inattentive [[The Elven Council]] as they are afraid from threats / risks closing in from the west and want to protect the east.
	- This is interesting because a member of the handler gang was seemingly recruited by or at least had a flyer from a western power called the cleave [[note in a bandit tent]]
- After [[Session 8]] We learn that the elven council is all made up of one tribe and has placed / made positions for family members to have control over zul & potential control over the east beacon - this family is the [[Torfir Tribe]] and they also own [[Goods of the Tribe]]
- The [[note in a bandit tent]] that we found on the 8th of Arvandor was probably handed out in the west beacon during the holiday [[Highsummer]]
- [[The Cleve]] is something important to the west beacon and has a holiday that serves to remember a time before it for citizens and a celebration of it for those more evil - the holiday is called [[Sorrow]].
